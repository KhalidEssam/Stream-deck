To turn your phone into a stream deck, you will need a combination of software tools and possibly some additional hardware components. Here's a general outline of what you might need:

1. **Mobile App Development Tools:**
   You'll need software tools to develop the mobile application for your phone. Depending on your phone's operating system, you can choose the appropriate development environment:
   - For Android: Android Studio (Java or Kotlin) or other Android app development frameworks.
   - For iOS: Xcode (Swift or Objective-C) for iOS app development.

2. **APIs and SDKs:**
   To interface your mobile app with the streaming software (like OBS or Streamlabs OBS) running on your computer, you'll need to use their APIs or SDKs. Many streaming software solutions provide APIs to interact with them programmatically. Make sure to check the documentation of your preferred streaming software to see what they offer.

3. **Communication Protocol:**
   Determine how your mobile app will communicate with your streaming software. It can be done through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or even via a USB cable. You may need to set up a custom communication protocol or use existing ones like WebSockets, RESTful APIs, or MIDI, depending on your setup and the streaming software's capabilities.

4. **Graphic Design Tools:**
   If you want to customize the appearance of your virtual stream deck buttons, you might need graphic design tools to create icons and layouts for the buttons.

5. **Hardware Components (Optional):**
   While the main functionality is in the software, you might consider some hardware components for enhanced functionality or better user experience. For example, you could use NFC tags, Bluetooth buttons, or even create a custom physical button pad if you have the necessary skills and equipment.

6. **Testing Devices:**
   For testing the app during development, you'll need access to Android and/or iOS devices. Emulators can be useful, but it's essential to test on real devices to ensure smooth performance and compatibility.

7. **Server-Side Development (Optional):**
   If you plan to use a cloud-based approach to handle communication between the mobile app and your computer, you might need server-side development tools. This could include programming languages like Python, Node.js, or frameworks like Django or Express.js.

8. **Documentation Tools:**
   As you develop your app, it's helpful to have tools for documentation, version control (e.g., Git), and project management.

Remember that the complexity of this project may vary depending on your desired features, platform support, and your programming skills. Building a virtual stream deck involves mobile app development, communication with the streaming software, and possibly additional hardware integration, so it's a multifaceted project that may require some time and effort to complete.

Sure! If you want to develop a basic Android app to turn your phone into a virtual stream deck, the following tools will be sufficient to get the job done:

1. **Android Studio:**
   Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. It provides everything you need to design, develop, test, and debug Android applications. You can download Android Studio for free from the official Android Developer website.

2. **Java or Kotlin:**
   Android apps can be developed using either Java or Kotlin programming languages. Java has been traditionally used for Android development, but Kotlin is gaining popularity due to its modern syntax and improved safety features. Choose the language that you are more comfortable with.

3. **Android SDK:**
   Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of libraries, tools, and resources that allow you to create and run Android applications. Android Studio comes bundled with the necessary SDK components, so you don't need to download it separately.

4. **Streaming Software API/SDK Documentation:**
   Look up the documentation for the API or SDK of the streaming software you plan to integrate with. For example, OBS Studio and Streamlabs OBS have APIs that you can use to control and interact with them programmatically.

5. **Communication Protocol:**
   Depending on your setup and streaming software's capabilities, you'll need to decide on a communication protocol to interact with the streaming software. WebSocket is a common choice, but you can explore other options that suit your requirements.

6. **Graphic Design Tools (Optional):**
   If you want to customize the appearance of your virtual stream deck buttons, you can use graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop or free alternatives like GIMP or Canva.

7. **Testing Devices:**
   You will need an Android phone for testing the app during development. If you don't have access to a physical Android device, you can use an Android emulator provided by Android Studio.

8. **Version Control (Optional):**
   While not mandatory, using version control like Git will help you manage your code and collaborate with others if needed.

9. **Documentation Tools (Optional):**
   If you plan to document your app or project, you can use tools like Javadoc for Java or KDoc for Kotlin to generate code documentation.

With these tools, you can get started on developing a basic Android app to turn your phone into a virtual stream deck. As you progress, you may explore additional features and tools to enhance the functionality and user experience of your app. Good luck with your project!
